  "course_description": "General introduction to systems engineering using both the classical V-model and the new _Meta_ approach. Topics include stakeholder analysis, requirements definition, system architecture and concept generation, trade-space exploration and concept selection, design definition and optimization, system integration and interface management, system safety, verification and validation, and commissioning and operations. Discusses the trade-offs between performance, lifecycle cost and system operability. Readings based on systems engineering standards and papers. Students apply the concepts of systems engineering to a cyber-electro-mechanical system, which is subsequently entered into a design competition.\n\nStudents will prepare a PDR (Preliminary Design Review)-level design intended for the _Cansat Competition_.This year's class will be taught in the form of a Small-Private-Online-Course (SPOC) and offered simultaneously to students at MIT under number 16.842 and Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL) as ENG-421.\n",
